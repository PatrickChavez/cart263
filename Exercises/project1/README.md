When conceptualizing a Sisyphean experience for the project, I wanted to create a situation where the user would have to move their mouse constantly, to the point of irritation. Eventually, I decided to have a system where the player tries to achieve the goal of slaying all enemies, but can’t due to said goal constantly increasing. Over time, the objective would reach an astronomical number and the user would grow more and more frustrated. This aspect, combined with the fact that foes can appear in any area of the window and only a single song plays on loop, can create an overall exhausting experience. 
  
In terms of aesthetics, I decided to choose the style of retro RPGS. This is due to the fact that many games during the period of the NES would demand players to defeat regular foes and level-up on a regular basis in order to progress the story and defeat bosses. This type of gameplay can be annoying to some due to its slow pace and repetitive nature. As such, I felt that this art style was appropriate for what I was trying to convey.
  
The project’s title, Slime Champion, was chosen for irony: the user is expected to easily attain the objective, but can’t seem to do so. Visually, it was inspired by the title screen of Dragon Warrior III, but the stone mural look was replaced with a much rounder and playful style. This is done to convey the squishiness of the game’s antagonists and accentuate a cartoony nature. The colors of the letters also represent the colors of the slimes that appear, but they are given a darker pallet to appear subdued and not distract the player.

On the subject of enemies, I settled for slimes due to them being a common enemy type in RPGs. As they are usually the first kind of enemy to be found in the games they feature, they are mostly felled in one hit by a player character. Because of this, I felt that the slimes dying to one click in the game was fitting. All of the enemy designs are based on countless monsters from different franchises. There is the adorable and iconic “Slime Family” set of monsters in Dragon Quest, as well as the Slime joke character featured in the Shin Megami Tensei games. The pink slime’s antennae was inspired by the Psychomanes found in Romancing SaGa 2 (ironically, slime-based enemies are notoriously difficult in that game). Finally, one of the biggest inspirations for this project were the Zols from the Zelda series: their gimmick of multiplying upon defeat was what gave me the idea to incorporate continually spawning monsters.
  
For the background, I settled on making a generic grass plain, as that area is where slimes are usually found in RPGs. The skeleton was included to add a bit of personality to the setting. Is it a fallen adventurer that was unlucky enough to be overwhelmed by monsters? Or is it a representation of the player giving up? 
  
Overall, these are the components that make up the project. For the most part, I’m satisfied with the aesthetics, as they allowed me to experiment with a limited color palette and create an interesting environment with my programming knowledge.
