After reading about James Bridle’s essay, I wanted to explore the idea of a YouTuber’s capacity to produce harmful content that children end up discovering. As such, I created Glory Seeker, a short game where the player is often presented with the option of doing morally questionable acts. This aspect of the experience was based on the belief that people always have the capacity to abstain from producing disturbing videos, but do so anyway due to stress, obliviousness or malicious intent.

Glory Seeker’s three scenarios are based on popular content that dominated YouTube over the past few years. The first subject is about the “Finger Family” series of videos, which have become prevalent among YouTube’s children-oriented content. While many are harmless music videos, there are some that feature objects such as skulls in the place of family members, among many other strange things. The second topic is about the “3AM Challenges”, which depict content creators calling fictional characters, who then proceed to “haunt” them. While the nature of these videos is usually lighthearted, there have been cases where YouTubers have tried to “come into contact” with deceased relatives and celebrities whom have recently passed away. The third and final subject references the “Elsagate” phenomenon, which depicts actors playing the roles of copyrighted characters performing strange and sometimes disgusting actions on video. The game however explores the abusive nature certain YouTubers have towards their actors (some being children) behind the scenes. In summary, each subject has an abundant number of videos related to them and has seen a lot of scrutiny due to their bizarre and controversial nature. Because children are often the target audience for these kinds of videos, I felt it appropriate to incorporate these subjects into the game.

The feeling of desperation was taken into account when presenting the game. The title is supposed to evoke a distressed search for fame. The colors and font used for the title image are the main components of YouTube’s logo design; this was done in order to set the game’s theme. In addition, the word Seeker is in red in order to demonstrate an overwhelming need for attention. The “regular” voice that narrates the story represents the fact that the player is in a good state of mind. The voice takes a more sinister tone whenever a decision is to be made; this is done in order to represent the avatar’s inner turmoil in the face of their deadline. The “evil” voice is like the devil on a person’s shoulder, telling them to do the wrong deed. The music stops abruptly during these “decision sections” for dramatic effect. Whenever the player caves in and makes a bad decision, the webpage background turns red; this is done to highlight the severity of the player’s actions, as well as provide a dreary atmosphere. Furthermore, the narrator’s voice is back to normal, as if the player’s conscience is reprimanding them for their poor decision.

Overall, Glory Seeker is a game about keeping a cool head when stressed. The player always has the option to produce harmful content and whether or not they chose to do it depends on their curiosity or morals. Everyone has the choice of producing harmful content and should be prepared to face the consequences should they do so.
