When conceptualizing "From Me To You", I wanted to create a game where the player would have to interact with objects in order to reach a positive conclusion. In addition, I also wanted said objects to provide context for the story. Ultimately, the finished project became a short visual novel about the relationship between two people, told through a series of flashbacks. 

In terms of game design, the menu-based interface was inspired by old adventure games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, such as "Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom" and "Shadowgate". This was done in order to give the player the freedom of choice in how they wished to experience the story and gameplay segments. The three objects that the player interacts with each have a small objective that, when completed, rewards them with an ingredient number. This is to incentivise using the “think” option in order to gain a hint or know the answer to an object’s task. Two endings were made in order to motivate players to pay attention to the story segments and figure out the puzzles, lest they receive an unsatisfying conclusion.

Aesthetics played an important part in the presentation of the various backgrounds. Blue was chosen as the main color for the user interface; because liquid was a dominant theme in the story (due to the inclusion of potion-making and mermaids), I felt it appropriate to choose a color closely associated with water. Another reason for this choice was due to the fact that blue’s cool, subdued nature allows the player to focus more on the p5 canvas. Oscar’s room, the hub area, was given several shades of orange as part of its color scheme as well as display the three important items. This was done in order to give the room a warm, cozy feeling and to show the player the main objectives of the game. In contrast, the forest area seen in the flashbacks and endings uses a lot of dark shades to convey a sense of loneliness and isolation. Furthermore, the use of brushstrokes to depict the vegetation gives the area a sense of mysticism and otherworldliness.

When working on the story, I wanted it to serve as an incentive to explore the game world. I settled with creating a relaxed, somewhat endearing narrative very loosely based on "The Little Mermaid". The tale peers into the lives of two good friends named Oscar and Emily. Oscar’s plain clothes and friendly demeanor paints him as your typical everyman; however, his style of clothing is loose and unkempt with a dominance of blue shades, which gives him an overall lax personality. By contrast, Emily has a more prim and proper style to her; this aspect, coupled with her overall positive attitude and dominant red shades, depicts a caring girl who believes in Oscar’s capabilities and who is willing to push him in the right direction. There is also a sense of loneliness in the lives of these two: both of them don’t interact with a lot of people and both have problems regarding their relatives. As such, they tend to rely on each other for emotional and social support.

Overall, the creation of "From Me To You" was definitely an ambitious project that took a lot of time and dedication to make. Despite this, it was also a productive experience in teaching me how games of this nature are developed.
